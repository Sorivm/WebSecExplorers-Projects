# XOR Tool - File Encoding & Decoding 🔒

Welcome to the **XOR Tool**! A simple yet powerful utility that lets you **encode** and **decode** file names and contents using the XOR (Exclusive OR) operation. This tool showcases basic encryption, ideal for educational and developmental purposes.

## ✨ **How XOR Works**

XOR is an encryption technique where each byte of data is **XORed** with a key, making the data unrecognizable. Here's the magic:

- **Encrypting:** Files are first renamed and then their contents are XORed using a custom key.
- **Decrypting:** Apply the same key again, and voilà! Your files are restored to their original state.

This process ensures **reversibility**: Encrypt and decrypt with the same key for perfect consistency.

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **File Name Encoding:**  
   The tool changes file names by XORing each character with the key. This makes the names unreadable and encrypted.

2. **File Content Encoding:**  
   Not only are the file names scrambled, but the contents are also XORed with the same key. The entire file becomes encrypted.

3. **Reversal (Decoding):**  
   Want to revert to the original files? Simply run the tool with the same key and select **decode** mode.

## 🚀 **Why XOR?**

- **Simplicity:**  
   XOR is a simple and effective encryption method that doesn’t require complex cryptography algorithms.

- **Moderate Security:**  
   While not suitable for highly sensitive data, XOR is an excellent tool for educational purposes or simple applications.

- **Reversible Process:**  
   The best feature: Apply the same key to reverse the operation and get your original files back.

## 🛠️ **How to Use**

### To Encrypt Files:
1. Run the tool with your target folder and a **key** of your choice.
2. The tool will rename and encrypt the file contents automatically.

### To Decrypt Files:
1. Run the tool again with the same **key** and select **decode**.
2. Your files will return to their original names and contents.
